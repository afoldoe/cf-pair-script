# cf-pair-script

This is a helper for Code Fellows staff in making up pairs for paired programming. It matches up students based on their experience and if they've been paired with each other before. It's built with jQuery, NodeJS, and MongoDB.

##Usage

To customize, edit the client/data/students.json file. Use the 'Populate Students' button to add students in the json file to the database. Create pairs with the 'Create Pairs' button, however, remember that they only save to the database when you hit the 'Save Pairs' button.
